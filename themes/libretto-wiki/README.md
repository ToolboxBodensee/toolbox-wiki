 Libretto Wiki Theme
=====================

Sophisticated, simple, and classically styled, Libretto is designed to showcase
your writing prowess! A unique feature of this theme is that it does NOT rely
on any Javascript. It's built using HTML, CSS and a few fonts. Best of all,
the theme is responsive - yes, it works on mobiles and tablets too!!

The Theme here is optimized to work as wiki. But you don't have to provide
any PHP and User Management stuff. You can redirect the Users directly to
your git, where your website is stored!

# Theme Highlights

* Classic looks!
* Navigation links on top-right (for tablet/desktop)
* Blog description at bottom
* Support for custom copyright notices at bottom-left
* Icon links to social sites at bottom-right
* Mobile support! (Looks good on my android phone, at least!)
* Tag support!
* No Javascript! (for now..?)
* Optimized for Wiki Usage

This is my first effort at making a theme and I hope you will enjoy using it!


# Un-supported features

Here is a list of Nikola features (that I'm aware of) which are currently not
supported with this theme,

* 3rd-party comment system  (is it even possible to do this without JS ?)

If you want a feature to be supported by this theme, please make a request for
it via the theme's official Github issues tracker,

<https://github.com/note2self-abrahamvarricatt/libretto-theme-for-nikola/issues>

As long as it isn't troublesome, I'll try to add it in.


## Original Inspiration

This theme is based off a Wordpress theme of the same name. You can find the
original here,
